## Assignment ##

1. **Choose a shape** to draw, and save its reference
   image as
   `./assets/<roll-no>-0x07-2d-primitives-refimg.png`.
   Remember to replace `<roll-no>`.  It should reflect
   in the `index.html` upon clicking "Show image."
   Also upload it to the form along with your
   submission.  Here's a reference on [how to choose a
   shape](./suggestions.md#how-to-choose-a-shape), for
   anyone interested.
2. **Draw the shape**.  Use [canvas draw
   functions](./quick-reference.md#geometry-definition)
   to create the shape so as to redefine and complete
   the function
   [`Experiment.createGeometry`](./experiment.js#L56).
3. **Transform**.  Refactor the function
   [`Experiment.getBaseTransform`](./experiment.js#L86)
   to generate a suitable initial state for the shape.
   Also see [the suggestions for its
   implementation](./suggestions.md#how-to-implement-transforms),
   [useful
   API](./quick-reference.md#dommatrix-interface) and
   [its math](./transformation-math.md).
4. **Stylise**.  Refactor the function
   [`Experiment.getBaseStyles`](./experiment.js#L104)
   to generate a soothing style. Here's a quick
   reference on [rendering and stylisation using HTML
   Canvas](./quick-reference.md#rendering-canvas-in-2d).
5. **UI**. Refactor the function
   [`Experiment.handleTransforms`](./experiment.js#L45)
   to handle the inputs from UI.
6. **Collage**.  Snapshot a few of your canvases using
   Download button; and compile a collage using the
   same.  Rename the collage as follows and upload it
   to the form along with your submission.  
   `<roll-no>-0x07-2d-primitives-collage.png`

## Submit ##

1. Git URL
2. Commit ID
3. Reference Image (of the shape chosen in Step 1)
4. Teaser (from Collage in Step 6)

### Evaluation Criteria ###

+ *1 mark*: Clarity on what is a good shape to start
  with and creativity of composition; based on
  `refimg` + `collage`;
+ *1 mark*: Implementation of Render Engine;
+ *1 mark*: UI gluing.

## Objective ##

+ Use
  [`Path2D`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D)
  to define primitives.
+ Define geometric transforms and apply using
  [`addPath`
  interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D/addPath),
  including
  + Rigid-body tranforms
  + Reflection
  + Shear
+ Rendering the canvas, *e.g.*
  + [Stroke
    outline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/stroke)
    with [Line
    type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setLineDash),
    [Line
    width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineWidth),
    and
    [Color/Gradient/Pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeStyle)
  + [Fill
    Region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fill)
    with
    [Color/Gradient/Pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle)
